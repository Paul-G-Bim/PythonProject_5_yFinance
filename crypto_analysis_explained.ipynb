    "## 1. Moving Averages (Simple Moving Average - SMA)\n",
    "**Formula:** SMA<sub>n</sub>(t) = (1/n) * Σ<sub>i=0..n-1</sub> Price(t-i)\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it measures:** The SMA smooths price data by averaging the previous *n* periods. It reduces noise and reveals the underlying trend direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation:** A rising SMA suggests an uptrend; a falling SMA suggests a downtrend. Traders commonly use crossovers (e.g., 7-day vs 21-day) to generate buy/sell signals: when the short SMA crosses above the long SMA, it indicates momentum shifting upward (a buy), and vice versa for sells.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Caveats:** SMAs lag price (more lag with larger *n*). They can give false signals during choppy markets.\n"

    "## 2. Relative Strength Index (RSI)\n",
    "**Formula (classic):**\n",
    "\n",
    "RS = Average Gain<sub>n</sub> / Average Loss<sub>n</sub>\n",
    "\n",
    "RSI = 100 - (100 / (1 + RS))\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it measures:** RSI quantifies the speed and change of price movements. It oscillates between 0 and 100 and is typically calculated over 14 periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation:** Traditionally, RSI > 70 indicates overbought conditions (possible pullback), and RSI < 30 indicates oversold conditions (possible bounce). Divergences between price and RSI (price makes new high but RSI doesn't) can signal weakening momentum.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Caveats:** RSI can remain overbought/oversold for extended periods in strong trends — it does not guarantee an immediate reversal.\n"

    "## 3. Bollinger Bands\n",
    "**Formula:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Middle Band = SMA<sub>n</sub>\n",
    "\n",
    "Upper Band = SMA<sub>n</sub> + k * σ<sub>n</sub>\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "where σ<sub>n</sub> is the rolling standard deviation over n periods, and k is typically 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it measures:** Bollinger Bands capture volatility around a moving average. Wider bands indicate higher volatility; narrower bands indicate lower volatility.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation:** Price touching the upper band can indicate strength or overbought conditions; touching the lower band can indicate weakness or oversold conditions. 'Squeezes' (bands narrow) often precede volatility breakouts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Caveats:** Bands do not provide direction — a breakout can be up or down. Combine with momentum indicators (like RSI) for context.\n"

    "## 4. Daily Returns & Volatility\n",
    "**Formula:** Daily Return = (P<sub>t</sub> / P<sub>t-1</sub>) - 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Volatility is commonly estimated as the standard deviation of daily returns (annualized by multiplying by sqrt(252) for trading days).\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it measures:** Returns measure period-to-period changes; volatility measures dispersion of those returns (risk).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation:** Higher volatility implies higher risk (and potentially higher reward). Comparing volatility across assets helps in portfolio construction and risk management.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Caveats:** Volatility is backward-looking and sensitive to the chosen window. Use multiple horizons to get a fuller picture.\n"

    "**Formula:** Pearson correlation between two series X and Y: Corr(X,Y) = Cov(X,Y) / (σ<sub>X</sub> σ<sub>Y</sub>)\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it measures:** Correlation quantifies the linear relationship between asset returns. Values range from -1 (perfect negative) to +1 (perfect positive).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation:** High positive correlation means assets move together (low diversification benefit). Negative correlation can provide hedging.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Caveats:** Correlation is not causation and can change over time, especially in crisis periods when correlations often increase.\n"

    "## 6. Simple Backtesting (SMA Crossover)\n",
    "**Procedure:**\n",
    "1. Compute short and long SMAs.\n",
    "2. Generate a 'long' signal when short SMA > long SMA; exit when short SMA < long SMA.\n",
    "3. Buy at next period's close on a signal; sell at next period's close on exit.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it measures:** This tests a momentum-based trading rule and estimates hypothetical portfolio value over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation:** Compare strategy returns to buy-and-hold to gauge if the rule adds value after accounting for slippage and costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Caveats:** Simple backtests omit transaction costs, slippage, realistic fill assumptions, and lookahead bias. Use more robust backtesting frameworks for production strategies.\n"
